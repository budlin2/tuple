/*
    Not providing default styles for itemHover and itemActive:
    This active issue details why:
        https://github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/3924
    Basically, Vite is screwing up the order by which CSS modules
    are loaded, so the styles for itemHover and itemActive are
    are being applied before the styles passed into them via
    the `classes` prop.

    It's weird. If I clear the cache, it will be correct on the first
    page render and then incorrect on every subsequent page render.

    Keep an eye on styles that get passed in a production app.
